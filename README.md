# Heart-Failure-Classification

## Overview
This is a **group project** for **STAT 4000: Introduction to Data Science** focused on predicting heart failure mortality using machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and contains clinical records of patients with heart failure.

üîó **Dataset Link:** [Heart Failure Clinical Records](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records)

## Project Components
The project involves:
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handling missing values, feature selection, and data transformations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing feature distributions, correlations, and class imbalances.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Model Performance Assessment**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrices
  - Feature Importance Analysis

## Results
The models were evaluated based on **classification metrics** and **feature importance** to identify the most significant predictors of mortality.
